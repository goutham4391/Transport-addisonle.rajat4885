Once a sleepy patch of grass used to farm local sheep, this incredibly smart corner of London is now one of its most elite areas. Check out our Mayfair taxi driver\u2019s guide for some clues on where best to dine, drink and visit while you\u2019re here. We\u2019ll begin this guide with a small disclaimer: if you\u2019re looking for hidden bargains, secret savings or discount diamonds, Mayfair\u2019s probably not the best place to start. No, this is a place where not only London &#8211; but the world\u2019s &#8211; jet set come to stay, shop and socialise. Cornered in between lively Soho, lush Hyde Park and the rather regal Buckingham Palace; Mayfair embraces all that is lavish and glamorous. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. Mayfair was, as we mentioned, once a pastoral glade; an area that was widely untouched and uncivilised save for the occasional farmhouse. It wasn\u2019t until the May Fair (a yearly two week long carnival celebration) was moved to the area from Haymarket that it started to find itself an identity. And when the Fair was eventually cancelled in 1764, the land was suddenly ripe for development. Of course it didn\u2019t hurt being in what would eventually become the W1 postcode. Bridging a gap between the famous shopping arcades of Oxford Street and the palatial home of the British monarchy. Today you\u2019ll find such extravagant hotels as The Dorchester and Grosvenor House on the highly desirable Park Lane (and Claridge\u2019s \u201ctucked away\u201d not far behind them). The US, Canadian and Italian Embassies all interspersed around the area. Not to mention dozens of haute couture designer brands to keep the shoppers happy. Addison Lee have been serving Londoners for over 30 years the only way we know how: with a prompt, reliable and always safe service. A service you know you can rely on. Follow our Mayfair taxi driver\u2019s guide to the area to uncover some of W1\u2019s finest gems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to lovely, lovely Mayfair.
