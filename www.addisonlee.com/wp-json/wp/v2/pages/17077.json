Vision<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Addison Lee was established in 1975 with the belief that ground transportation could be done better.\u00a0 By combining the latest technologies with traditional customer service values, we disrupted the industry (before disrupting industries had even become a thing).\u00a0 We combine exceptional reliability, a high level of safety, sophisticated technology and 24\/7 support teams to ensure our customers receive a first-class service that offers excellent value for money.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our headquarters are based in London, and we are supported by offices located across the UK.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our service does not stop at people.\u00a0 We are the market leader in London for Same Day delivery with over 400 vans, 120 motorcycles and 40 cycles to move your parcels and packages with the same immaculate service you would expect from our passenger cars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have over 500 employees within the Group in addition to approximately 4000 drivers who are engaged through our supply chain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our vision is to be the world\u2019s premium brand ground transportation service for our customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To support our vision, we aim to provide an environment for employees and partners where they are respected, valued and supported.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We work with likeminded partners and suppliers whose values and ethos align with our own.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Our Employees<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are many aspects of our culture that makes up our unique environment.\u00a0 Maintaining and strengthening our culture is part of our everyday working life and underpins much of our corporate policy.\u00a0\u00a0 We strive to create an enjoyable and safe environment where our staff can excel.\u00a0 We recognise our staff as our most important asset and employee welfare is a key objective that is linked to the company\u2019s unique culture and values.\u00a0 We do not tolerate discrimination, abuse or harassment of any kind and we expect the same of our stakeholder groups including, but not limited to:\u00a0 customers, manufacturers, shareholders, suppliers and employees.\u00a0 All staff must adhere to our codes of conduct and company standards and policies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We operate a thorough recruitment and selection process for all our hiring decisions.\u00a0 This includes obtaining documented proof of an individual\u2019s right to work in the country in which they be employed.\u00a0 Should a concern arise we operate an open-door communication policy and we also provide a protected disclosure facility should a staff member require confidentiality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We always pay at least the minimum wage rate applicable.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Our Supply Chain<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We only work with reputable suppliers, most of whom we have partnered with for many years, and we take responsibility for endeavouring to ensure our supply chains are free from slave labour.\u00a0 Our Procurement and Affiliates teams are dedicated to managing trade and partner relationships.\u00a0 We ensure suppliers are appropriately licensed to carry out the service they are providing. Spend commitments are subject to legal contracts and we do not pay cash for services.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our Partners and Suppliers are required to comply with our Operating Principles including adherence to all relevant legislation in the countries in which they operate and all relevant International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions. The principles set expectations around the adoption of standards regarding forced and compulsory labour; child labour; health, safety and hygiene; abuse and discipline; freedom of association and employee representation; remuneration; employment terms; working hours; equality of treatment; and community impact and aim to ensure that all partners and suppliers adhere to high standards of ethical, environmental and social behaviour.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Our Activities to date &amp; Future<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As part of risk management process, we continue to review threats and consider any existing or future arrangements.\u00a0 We have developed a review process to monitor and manage and mitigate risks.\u00a0 Risks previously identified in this area have resulted in the introduction of our Supplier and Partner Operating Principles, enhancements to our supplier due diligence and we are working on developing our supplier categorisation programme.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have identified our third-party car wash services as a potential risk area for worker exploitation.\u00a0 As a result, we have an objective set for 2019\/20 to ensure that the suppliers we work with are a member of the Responsible Car Wash Programme. This programme aims to support best practice in hand car washes and reduce the prevalence of modern slavery in the sector by operating a voluntary certification programme rather than a licensing programme. The programme is supported by many sectors, the modern slavery charity UNSEEN and several government agencies including the GLAA alongside industry representatives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have updated our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Standard which requires all staff to promptly report any concerns or suspicions of malpractice, and to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of the Standard.\u00a0\u00a0 It is made available to all staff via the company intranet and publicly on request. The Standard now has a Governance framework formally documented. Failure to comply with the Standard will be investigated and may be treated as a disciplinary offence. We may terminate our relationship with individuals and organisations working on our behalf if they breach this Standard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our Supplier and Partner Operating Principles and contracts are due for review in 2021\/22 and will be updated as appropriate and we have reviewed and updated our procurement procedures to ensure that suppliers undergo appropriate due diligence and our next steps will be to develop supplier categorisation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our Affiliate department maintain close relationships with our partners for ground transportation and will be reviewing the due diligence performed for these suppliers in 2021\/22.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We will also, where appropriate and practical, continue to visit our partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 offices, both in the UK and abroad.\u00a0 This will assist us in being familiar with how they operate and what safeguards they have in place to reduce, remove and prevent the use of slave or forced labour in their organisations and their supply chains.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These measures are part of a continuous improvement journey with suppliers and partners and we recognise that further down our supply chains, suppliers and partners may need more support and we will appraise the partner and supplier review process to enable us to monitor adherence on a periodic basis as appropriate to the supplier and\/or partner.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The development of our audit programme is enabling compliance checks with all our policies and procedures and we are developing our reporting functionality in this area.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We continue to make sure that our employees are aware of the Modern Slavery Act, of the definitions of slavery and human trafficking and that they know what to do should they suspect a case of slavery or human trafficking. To better support this, our employee induction and compliance training programme is being updated.\u00a0 Our Head of Procurement holds the Professional level of the CIPS Global Standard for Procurement and Supply qualification, and plans are in place to extend the CIPS qualification to the rest of the team.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This statement is reviewed and updated annually and has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by Addison Lee and other relevant group companies during the financial year ending 2021\/22 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Addison Lee\u2019s financial year runs from 1st September \u2013 31<sup>st<\/sup> August<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Approved by the Addison Lee
