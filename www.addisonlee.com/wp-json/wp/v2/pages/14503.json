Which is why when it comes to getting around, you need the right Wimbledon taxi service to take you where you need to go.<\/p>\n<p>Addison Lee are proud to have been providing London with premium private hire minicabs since 1975. We\u2019ve done this by offering a service that\u2019s not only reliable, but also consistently comfortable and safe. Today we undertake over 2,000 journeys across the city each day, with everyone being treated to the same level of professionalism and cost effectiveness &#8211; regardless of location, journey distance or time of day. Wimbledon may be famous for tennis and Wombles (if you\u2019re not sure &#8211; look them up!) but it was the train station that made it the place it is today. Like so many areas of south London, Wimbledon was once just a village in Surrey. It wasn\u2019t until a transport link into the city was built in 1838 that it begun to become part of London itself. Home to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and one of the largest areas of public land in London (Wimbledon Common), this shining gem of south west London has always been one of the most desirable spots in the British capital. Any doubters should check out Wimbledon Parkside (often referred to as Millionaire\u2019s Row). Where house prices are listed at a salty average of half a million pounds per property. But you don\u2019t need to be a gazillionaire to enjoy Wimbledon\u2019s many delights. Just hop on a train and and come and visit. The station is easily accessible from both central London and the South of England. Once here all you\u2019ll need is and Addison Lee and our handy Wimbledon taxi driver\u2019s guide to the area. Honestly, what\u2019s stopping you?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you\u2019re here for the tennis, a stroll on the common or just stopping by to enjoy the area, SW19 &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn cta mini understrap-read-more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addisonlee.com\/wimbledon\/\">Read More&#8230;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":59,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"templates\/template-location.php","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v16.7 (Yoast SEO v19.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Wimbledon Minicabs &amp; Cabs | Book Online &amp; Local Attraction Guide | Addison Lee<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Looking for a minicab from Wimbledon?
