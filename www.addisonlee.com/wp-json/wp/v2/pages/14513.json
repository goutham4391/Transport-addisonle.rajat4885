Struggling to make your way through Oxford Street\u2019s hordes of zealous shoppers? Don\u2019t panic &#8211; help is at hand. Our Soho taxi driver\u2019s guide will ably see you through even the largest crowds of meandering tourists, and have you enjoying some of the area\u2019s more refined establishments in no time. For a lot of people, Soho is less an actual tangible area and more of a giant adult playground. The densely packed heart of London, where nothing and no-one ever slows down, let alone sleeps. But, of course, unlike Neverland, Soho is real. For a rough guide on its boundaries, draw a square between the four points at Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and Tottenham Court Rd tube stations. One square mile of endless bars, restaurants, clubs and shops. From the completely independent to the globally renowned. They can all be found in buzzy Soho. Packed in between these four corners is a world unto itself. The exciting, luminous, beating heart of London that pulsates with the vibrations of neon lights and swathes of giddy tourists. The Piccadilly Lights, Chinatown, The West End, Golden Square and even the famous Red Light District. Soho icons, every one. Obviously when it comes to things to do and &#8211; in particular &#8211; places to dine out or drink in, Soho\u2019s cup runneth over. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it any easier to find the right spot for you. Addison Lee have been serving this &#8211; and every &#8211; part of London since 1975.
